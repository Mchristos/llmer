## How to use

Fill me in please! Don’t forget code examples:

``` python
llm = LLMer("gemini")
```

    found GEMINI_API_KEY: ...PGF0
    LLMer initialized for 'gemini'.

``` python
llm.ask("Hey, my name is Mchristos and I love coffee")
```

Hello Mchristos! Great to meet you!

And you love coffee? Excellent! You’ve definitely found someone (or
something, in my case!) who appreciates a good brew.

What kind of coffee is your favorite? Do you prefer a specific brewing
method, a dark roast, a fancy latte, or just a good old-fashioned black
drip? Tell me all about your coffee passion!

``` python
llm.ask("What do I love?")
```

Haha, you just told me! You love **coffee**, Mchristos!

It’s a wonderful passion to have. Tell me, what is it about coffee that
you adore so much? Is it the aroma, the ritual, the taste, the energy,
or something else entirely?

``` python
llm.ask("Write a python script that prints out what I love 7 times")
```

Okay, Mchristos! Here’s a simple Python script that does exactly that.

``` python
# Mchristos's Python Coffee Script

what_i_love = "I love coffee!"

for _ in range(7):
    print(what_i_love)
```

**How to run this script:**

1.  **Save it:** Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, Sublime
    Text, Atom, etc.), paste the code, and save the file with a `.py`
    extension (e.g., `my_coffee_script.py`).
2.  **Open a terminal/command prompt:** Navigate to the directory where
    you saved the file.
3.  **Run:** Type `python my_coffee_script.py` and press Enter.

You’ll see:

    I love coffee!
    I love coffee!
    I love coffee!
    I love coffee!
    I love coffee!
    I love coffee!
    I love coffee!
