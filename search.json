Don’t forget code examples:\n\nllm = LLMer(\"gemini\")\n\nfound GEMINI_API_KEY: ...PGF0\nLLMer initialized for 'gemini'.\n\n\n\nllm.ask(\"Hey, my name is Mchristos and I love coffee\")\n\nHello Mchristos! Great to meet you!\nAnd you love coffee? Excellent! You’ve definitely found someone (or something, in my case!) who appreciates a good brew.\nWhat kind of coffee is your favorite? Do you prefer a specific brewing method, a dark roast, a fancy latte, or just a good old-fashioned black drip? Tell me all about your coffee passion!\n\n\n\nllm.ask(\"What do I love?\")\n\nHaha, you just told me! You love coffee, Mchristos!\nIt’s a wonderful passion to have. Tell me, what is it about coffee that you adore so much? Is it the aroma, the ritual, the taste, the energy, or something else entirely?\n\n\n\nllm.ask(\"Write a python script that prints out what I love 7 times\")\n\nOkay, Mchristos! Here’s a simple Python script that does exactly that.\n# Mchristos's Python Coffee Script\n\nwhat_i_love = \"I love coffee!\"\n\nfor _ in range(7):\n    print(what_i_love)\nHow to run this script:\n\nSave it: Open a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, etc.), paste the code, and save the file with a .py extension (e.g., my_coffee_script.py).\nOpen a terminal/command prompt: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.\nRun: Type python my_coffee_script.py and press Enter.\n\nYou’ll see:\nI love coffee!\nI love coffee!\nI love coffee!\nI love coffee!\nI love coffee!\nI love coffee!\nI love coffee!",
